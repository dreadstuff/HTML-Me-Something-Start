      <div class="whereToFind"><h2>Here's little bit about Hoffman's Two-toed sloth:</h2> <br>
      All two-toed sloths have a number of adaptations related to their upside-down, arboreal lifestyle. They are the only mammals to have hair curves from stomach to back. Also due to their upside-down lifestyle, their face hair grows “up,” which guides water off their faces when it rains. They have about half of the muscle mass of comparable mammals, giving them a light body weight that is useful for living in trees. Their body temperature is exceptionally variable, which enables them to conserve energy.

   <h2>5 Cool Sloth Facts</h2>
   <ol>
     <li><strong>Slow Movers, Fast Digesters:</strong> Sloths move so slowly that algae grow on their fur, but their unique digestive system can take up to a month to fully digest a single leaf!</li>
     <li><strong>Masters of Camouflage:</strong> Thanks to the algae on their fur, sloths blend perfectly into the green canopy, making it hard for predators to spot them.</li>
     <li><strong>Hanging Out, Literally:</strong> Sloths spend about 90% of their lives hanging upside down from tree branches, even sleeping in this position for 15-20 hours a day!</li>
     <li><strong>Strong Swimmers:</strong> Surprisingly, sloths are excellent swimmers! They use their long arms to efficiently paddle through water, crossing rivers in search of new trees.</li>
     <li><strong>A Mysterious Smile:</strong> Sloths are known for their seemingly permanent smile, but this is just how their facial structure is formed, not necessarily an indication of their mood.</li>
